  "kizuna_math_d_select_01": "An ambush?!",
  "kizuna_math_d_select_02": "Why?!",
  "kizuna_math_d_03": "Well, you see, it’s not very pleasant knowing\nshe’s just staring at me all the time.[npcn:25]",
  "kizuna_math_d_04": "And now I know what she looks like after seeing\nher in the cafeteria![npcn:25]",
  "kizuna_math_d_05": "Ah![npcn:25]",
  "kizuna_math_d_06": "It’s you, isn’t it?! You’re the one who’s been\nsecretly watching me recently![npcn:25]",

  "kizuna_math_d_woman_02": "I guess you must have noticed me... I-I’m so sorry!",
  "kizuna_math_d_07": "Well, of course I noticed—you were watching me\npractically all day every day, after all!\\c\nI assume there’s something you want to ask me?[npcn:25]",

  "kizuna_math_d_woman_05": "But you just suddenly retired from your post as\nGym Leader a year and a half ago...\\c\nWhy did you quit?!",
  "kizuna_math_d_09": "My goodness... Is that all you wanted to ask?[npcn:25]",
  "kizuna_math_d_woman_06": "Yes. Your reason for retiring was never\nmade public...",

  "kizuna_math_d_woman_13": "Thank you so much, Ms. Tyme!",
  "kizuna_math_d_19": "Well, I suppose that solves the mystery![npcn:25]",
  "kizuna_math_d_20": "Ahhh, that made me so nervous! I said so many\nthings to try to sound cool![npcn:25]",
  "kizuna_math_d_21": "I was certainly a little scared when I felt that girl’s\nintense gaze on me.[npcn:25]",
