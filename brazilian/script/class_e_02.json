  "class_e_02_battle_02": "Is everyone excited about the Treasure Hunt?![npcn:24]",
  "class_e_02_battle_03": "It’s always a great adventure! You get to take on\nGyms, go to new places, and run all over the\\r\nplace with your partner Pokémon![npcn:24]",
  "class_e_02_battle_04": "And, while you’re running around out there,\nI’ll bet you’ll come across some big, shining\\r\n[clr:6]crystals [clr:0]fairly often as well.[npcn:24]",
  "class_e_02_battle_05": "These crystals are actually collections of Terastal\nenergy that’s seeped up out of the ground![npcn:24]",
  "class_e_02_battle_06": "You can check out these crystals to battle Tera\nPokémon with your friends or other Trainers in a\\r\ngroup of four.[npcn:24]",
  "class_e_02_battle_07": "We call those battles...Tera Raid Battles![npcn:24]",
  "class_e_02_battle_08": "The Tera Pokémon you’ll face off against in Tera\nRaid Battles are crazy tough![npcn:24]",
  "class_e_02_battle_09": "They sometimes act differently than regular\nPokémon, so you’ll need to be on your guard![npcn:24]",
  "class_e_02_battle_10": "Luckily, Trainers can also use a special action in\nTera Raid Battles. It’s called [clr:6]cheering[clr:0]![npcn:24]",
  "class_e_02_battle_11": "And there are three different cheers you can use![npcn:24]",
  "class_e_02_battle_12": "The first cheer is “[clr:6]Go all out![clr:0]” It boosts the\nAttack and Sp. Atk of all ally Pokémon.[npcn:24]",

  "class_e_02_battle_14": "And the third— Well, let’s see if you can guess![npcn:24]",
  "class_e_02_battle_15": "This cheer restores HP for all ally Pokémon.\nWhat do you think it is?[npcn:24]",
  "class_e_02_select_01": "Heal up!",

  "class_e_02_select_03": "Explosive healing wave!",
  "class_e_02_battle_answer_01": "That’s right! Maybe I should make YOU the battle\nteacher, huh, new kid?![npcn:24]",
  "class_e_02_battle_answer_02": "Wham-Bam Potion?! That sounds less like a cheer\nand more like a seriously heavy-handed medical\\r\ntreatment or something![npcn:24]",
  "class_e_02_battle_answer_03": "Explosive healing wave?! That’s a wild answer if\nI ever heard one! But I think I’d like to give that\\r\nmove a whirl if it really existed![npcn:24]",
  "class_e_02_battle_16": "The third and final cheer is “[clr:6]Heal up![clr:0]” It’s a real\npowerhouse, with the ability to both restore HP\\r\nand cure status conditions![npcn:24]",
  "class_e_02_battle_17": "You can cheer up to three times during a single\nTera Raid Battle.[npcn:24]",
  "class_e_02_battle_18": "Also, cheering uses up a turn in battle, so you\nwon’t be able to have your Pokémon use any of\\r\ntheir moves when you cheer![npcn:24]",
  "class_e_02_battle_19": "In conclusion![npcn:24]",
  "class_e_02_battle_20": "Try everything at your disposal! If nothing seems\nto be working, try cheering on your allies![npcn:24]",
  "class_e_02_battle_21": "Providing support for your team can sometimes\nopen up a new realm of possibilities![npcn:24]",
  "class_e_02_battle_22": "Aw, man! I was just about to suggest we do some\nhands-on practice to really drive the point home,\\r\nbut I guess we’re out of time...[npcn:24]",
  "class_e_02_battle_23": "Class is over for now! Take care, you little rascals![npcn:24]"
