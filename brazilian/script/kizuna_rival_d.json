  "kizuna_rival_d_02": "I had a feeling you’d turn up if I hung out here\nfor a while...[npcn:4]",
  "kizuna_rival_d_03": "And lo and behold, I was right![npcn:4]",
  "kizuna_rival_d_04": "Well, now that I’ve found you, we should swing\nby my room and have a chat![npcn:4]",
  "kizuna_rival_d_05": "Ta-ta-tachán! Welcome to the Zona Nemona![npcn:4]",
  "kizuna_rival_d_system_01": "It’s so tidy!",
  "kizuna_rival_d_system_02": "It’s very you!",
  "kizuna_rival_d_06": "Aw, thank— Wait a sec... I know we’ve been to\nYOUR room before...[npcn:4]",

  "kizuna_rival_d_11": "That’s what I did with Pokémon battles, and I...\njust kinda became a Champion?[npcn:4]",
  "kizuna_rival_d_12": "But then I found out that’s pretty special—that\nnormally, it’s not so simple for most people.[npcn:4]",
  "kizuna_rival_d_13": "People would tell me to my face that I’d only\nmanaged it ’cause I have some innate gift, or\\r\n’cause I was raised differently, or whatever.[npcn:4]",
  "kizuna_rival_d_14": "And suddenly I started to feel like there was this\ninvisible wall between me and everyone else.[npcn:4]",
  "kizuna_rival_d_15": "So I started going easy when I’d battle my\nfriends. I just wanted everyone to have fun.[npcn:4]",
  "kizuna_rival_d_16": "Oh, but don’t worry, I’m not doing that anymore!\nI’m going 100-percent all out![npcn:4]",
  "kizuna_rival_d_17": "Especially since I’m lucky enough to have an\nopponent around who can beat me even when\\r\nI’m in full hard-core mode![npcn:4]",

  "kizuna_rival_d_21": "Oof, that got pretty personal! Little bit\nembarrassed over here...[npcn:4]",
  "kizuna_rival_d_22": "Anyway! Since we’re equals, I gotta start having\nyou over as much as we hang out in your room![npcn:4]",
  "kizuna_rival_d_23": "Feel free to burst on into the Zona Nemona\nwhenever you want![npcn:4]",
