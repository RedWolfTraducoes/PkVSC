  "class_a_07_ecology_01": "Olá, olá. Espero que todos estejam prontos\npara aprender coisas novas hoje![npcn:2A]",
  "class_a_07_ecology_02": "Next time we meet, we’ll have our final exam.\nThat means today is our last actual class.[npcn:2A]",
  "class_a_07_ecology_03": "And the topic for this last class will be...Pokémon\n[clr:6]forms[clr:0]! You can just think of forms as the shapes\\r\nor appearances that Pokémon have.[npcn:2A]",
  "class_a_07_ecology_04": "There’s also a phenomenon called a [clr:6]form[clr:0]\n[clr:6]change[clr:0], where a Pokémon’s appearance\\r\nchanges under certain conditions.[npcn:2A]",
  "class_a_07_ecology_05": "Cyclizar, for example, which we regularly ride on\nas transportation here in Paldea, has three forms.[npcn:2A]",
  "class_a_07_ecology_06": "First is its basic form, where it walks on four\nlegs. Second is its battle form, where it stands\\r\non its hind legs to engage in battle.[npcn:2A]",
  "class_a_07_ecology_07": "Finally, there’s its ride form, where it inflates its\nthroat sac and its tail so we can ride on its back.[npcn:2A]",
  "class_a_07_ecology_08": "Though we can use something you’re all carrying\nwith you now as an even better example![npcn:2A]",
  "class_a_07_ecology_09": "Yup, I’m talking about your phones! Some\nsmartphones are inhabited by a certain Pokémon.[npcn:2A]",
  "class_a_07_ecology_10": "Does anyone know the Pokémon I’m referring to?[npcn:2A]",
  "class_a_07_select_01": "Rotom",
  "class_a_07_select_02": "Pikachu",
  "class_a_07_select_03": "Heracross",
  "class_a_07_ecology_answer_01": "You’re a regular expert on Pokémon AND\ntechnology, aren’t you, [trnm:0]![npcn:2A]",
  "class_a_07_ecology_answer_02": "It sure would be adorable if it were Pikachu in\nour phones—and it would probably make us want\\r\nto walk around more, too!\\c\nBut too bad, that’s not the right answer![npcn:2A]",
  "class_a_07_ecology_answer_03": "[BD06:0]Haha! I see where you’re coming from,\n[trnm:0]!\\c\nHeracross can learn a move called Smart Strike!\nSmartphone, Smart Strike... Well, unfortunately,\\r\nthere’s no connection![npcn:2A]",
  "class_a_07_ecology_11": "The Pokémon inside your smartphone is Rotom,\nand it does all sorts of things to help you out.[npcn:2A]",
  "class_a_07_ecology_12": "A Rotom inside a Rotom Phone is special, so it\ndoesn’t try to enter other electronics.[npcn:2A]",
  "class_a_07_ecology_13": "An ordinary Rotom, however, can change form by\nentering washing machines, microwave ovens,\\r\nand other electronic appliances.[npcn:2A]",
  "class_a_07_ecology_14": "Rotom is a bit of an exception, though. Many\nPokémon that change form do so simply by\\r\nholding an item or by having one used on them.[npcn:2A]",
  "class_a_07_ecology_15": "Oricorio, for example, has four different forms it\ncan change between when given certain nectars.[npcn:2A]",
  "class_a_07_ecology_16": "Pokémon may even change type or learn\ndifferent moves when they change form.[npcn:2A]",
  "class_a_07_ecology_17": "Form changes are different from Evolution in that\nthe Pokémon can return to its original form.\\c\nAnd unlike Shiny Pokémon, which can’t change\ntheir special coloration, the same individual\\r\nPokémon can go back and forth between\\r\nits forms.[npcn:2A]",
  "class_a_07_ecology_18": "There’s a lot to dig into with this form change\nphenomenon, as you can see![npcn:2A]",
  "class_a_07_ecology_19": "We can all learn something from Pokémon\nhere, don’t you think? Bit of a stretch, but...[npcn:2A]",
  "class_a_07_ecology_20": "I’d be happy to see you all enjoy your time at\nthe academy to the fullest...and change form\\r\ninto a new version of yourselves![npcn:2A]",
  "class_a_07_ecology_21": "Or something like that, anyway![npcn:2A]",
  "class_a_07_ecology_22": "Oh! I almost forgot![npcn:2A]",
  "class_a_07_ecology_23": "Regional forms, which vary based on what region\na Pokémon came from, don’t change like other\\r\nforms. They’re an innate—[npcn:2A]",
  "class_a_07_ecology_24": "Whoops. Heh...there’s the bell.[npcn:2A]",
  "class_a_07_ecology_25": "I guess I was scatterbrained Mr. Jacq right up to\nthe very end, huh?\\c\nI had a great time teaching all of you. I hope\nyou’ll do your best on the final exam![npcn:2A]"
