  "team_0150_nelke_01": "I’m glad I could see this through to the end.[npcn:1E]",
  "team_0150_botan_02": "I guess this is it for Team Star...and me, too—[npcn:8]",
  "team_0150_nelke_02": "Hold that thought, Mis— Ah...Penny! I’d like to\ncheck something with you first.[npcn:1E]",
  "team_0150_botan_03": "Check...what?[npcn:8]",
  "team_0150_nelke_03": "Why resort to something like Operation Starfall\nif you’re the big boss of Team Star?\\c\nWasn’t there any other way to handle this?[npcn:1E]",
  "team_0150_botan_04": "I tried telling the bosses that we were done once\nbefore. But they still didn’t quit...[npcn:8]",
  "team_0150_nelke_04": "Why not simply order them to?[npcn:1E]",
  "team_0150_botan_05": "Our code states that no one in the team has the\nright to order people around. I could ask them\\r\nall to do stuff, but I could never order them.[npcn:8]",
  "team_0150_nelke_05": "So, it’s back to the code once again... The bosses\nmust’ve taken it very seriously.[npcn:1E]",
  "team_0150_botan_06": "They did. That’s why I knew I could use it to force\nTeam Star to disband.[npcn:8]",
  "team_0150_nelke_06": "Because the bosses would do anything the code\nrequired of them? Even leave the team?[npcn:1E]",
  "team_0150_botan_07": "Yes... And according to the code, they had to\naccept any challenge made to them.[npcn:8]",
  "team_0150_nelke_07": "Thus the idea for Operation Starfall...[npcn:1E]",
  "team_0150_nelke_08": "Cassiopeia. Let me ask you one last thing.[npcn:1E]",
  "team_0150_nelke_09": "What does Team Star— No, what do your friends\nin the team mean to you?[npcn:1E]",
  "team_0150_botan_08": "... ... ...\nThey’re...[npcn:8]",
  "team_0150_botan_09": "They’re my greatest treasure.[npcn:8]",
  "team_0150_nelke_10": "Splendid. Thank you for apprising me of the\nsituation, Miss Penny.[npcn:1E]",
  "team_0150_botan_10": "Wha—?[npcn:8]",
  "team_0150_nelke_11": "Now, young lady, there’s something I should very\nmuch like to discuss with you.[npcn:1E]",
  "team_0150_botan_11": "Hey, quit it with the old geezer act, Clive!\nYou’re creeping me out...[npcn:8]",
  "team_0150_nelke_12": "...Indeed. Well then, before we talk further, allow\nme to reveal to you my own secret identity![npcn:1E]",

  "team_0150_botan_12": "D-Director Clavell?![npcn:8]",
  "team_0150_nelke_14": "Just as Cassiopeia was your disguise, the boy\nyou knew as Clive was mine![npcn:A]",
  "team_0150_botan_13": "But... But why?![npcn:8]",
  "team_0150_nelke_16": "I needed a way to talk to Team Star on\nequal terms.[npcn:A]",
  "team_0150_nelke_17": "Students do tend to shy from speaking their mind\nto their teachers, after all... Much more so when\\r\nfaced with the director of the academy.[npcn:A]",
  "team_0150_botan_14": "Yeah, but...where do I even start? Wasn’t the\noutfit a bit much?\\c\nPlus I have some big feelings about that wig...[npcn:8]",
  "team_0150_nelke_18": "Ahem! Well, that’s quite enough of that for now.\\c\nEveryone! Why don’t you come on out?[npcn:A]"
