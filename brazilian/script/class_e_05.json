  "class_e_05_battle_02": "You all gave everything you had on the midterm\nexams. Well done![npcn:24]",
  "class_e_05_battle_03": "We’ll resume our regular classes today, so keep\nup that energy for the second half of the term![npcn:24]",
  "class_e_05_battle_04": "Have you all been using the R Button to send out\nyour Pokémon?[npcn:24]",
  "class_e_05_battle_05": "If you do, your Pokémon will run off in the\ndirection you’re facing.[npcn:24]",
  "class_e_05_battle_06": "It’s a super-useful tactic that lets your Pokémon\npick up faraway items for you. And that’s not all![npcn:24]",
  "class_e_05_battle_07": "If there’s a wild Pokémon near where you sent\nyour Pokémon, they’ll start battling each other![npcn:24]",
  "class_e_05_battle_08": "We call those battles...Auto Battles![npcn:24]",
  "class_e_05_battle_09": "Just as the name implies, your Pokémon will\nact on its own during Auto Battles—meaning\\r\nyou won’t have to give it any commands![npcn:24]",
  "class_e_05_battle_10": "And if your Pokémon wins, it’ll get Exp. Points\njust like it would in a regular battle.[npcn:24]",
  "class_e_05_battle_11": "If you make good use of these battles, they can\nbe a really efficient way to train your party![npcn:24]",
  "class_e_05_battle_12": "But you’ll want to remember that Pokémon won’t\nevolve or learn new moves right away if they level\\r\nup from an Auto Battle.[npcn:24]",
  "class_e_05_battle_13": "Also, if a Pokémon LOSES an Auto Battle, it’ll\ncome back with just a small amount of HP left.\\r\nMake sure to heal it up right away![npcn:24]",
  "class_e_05_battle_14": "Whoops. I just about did the whole class as a\none-sided lecture. Does anyone have any\\r\nquestions so far?[npcn:24]",

  "class_e_05_select_03": "No questions here!",
  "class_e_05_battle_answer_01": "There’s no stopping an Auto Battle once it starts!\nYou’ll have to wait and see how it plays out!\\c\nYou can call your Pokémon off before the battle\nstarts, though, if you press the ZR Button while\\r\nyour Pokémon is still on its way to the opponent![npcn:24]",
  "class_e_05_battle_answer_02": "If you let your Pokémon battle on its own, it’ll\nkeep going until its opponent is defeated!\\c\nIf you want to catch a wild Pokémon, you’ll need\nto battle by issuing commands instead![npcn:24]",
  "class_e_05_battle_answer_03": "Great! You’re all really good at this. I can’t wait\nto see where you go from here![npcn:24]",
  "class_e_05_battle_15": "Even during Auto Battles, our Pokémon are out\nthere battling for us—their Trainers![npcn:24]",
  "class_e_05_battle_16": "Keep an eye on them as much as possible, and\nif it looks like they’re going to lose, be sure to\\r\nhave them retreat![npcn:24]",
  "class_e_05_battle_17": "Also, this goes without saying, but Pokémon with\nlow HP are already worn out.[npcn:24]",
  "class_e_05_battle_18": "They probably won’t enjoy Auto Battles as much,\nso don’t work them too hard, OK?[npcn:24]",
  "class_e_05_battle_19": "In conclusion![npcn:24]",
  "class_e_05_battle_20": "Auto Battles only work if a Trainer and their\nPokémon have a relationship of mutual trust![npcn:24]",
  "class_e_05_battle_21": "Be smart with how you use Auto Battles so you\ndon’t lose the trust of your Pokémon![npcn:24]",
  "class_e_05_battle_22": "Aw, man! I was just about to suggest we do some\nhands-on practice to really drive the point home,\\r\nbut I guess we’ve run out of time, as usual...[npcn:24]",
  "class_e_05_battle_23": "Class is over for now! Take care, you little rascals![npcn:24]"
