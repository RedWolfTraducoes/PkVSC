  "class_f_07_dragon_01": "Hello, class! It is I, Hassel, yet again.[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_07_dragon_02": "My, my, how time flies, as they say![npcn:12]",
  "class_f_07_dragon_03": "Indeed, our time together has certainly flown by.\nIt’s hard to believe that this is our last class.[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_07_dragon_04": "Now, our topics for today may feel somewhat\nunrelated to art.[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_07_dragon_05": "But there is absolutely no set definition as to\nwhat art should be![npcn:12]",
  "class_f_07_dragon_06": "Therefore, let us carry on with the discussion and\nsee where it takes us![npcn:12]",
  "class_f_07_dragon_07": "There are two things I wish to focus on today—\nRibbons...and marks![npcn:12]",
  "class_f_07_dragon_08": "Both Ribbons and marks are special honors that\ncapture a Pokémon’s qualities.[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_07_dragon_09": "There will be times when your Pokémon gives\nmaximum effort or has a noteworthy experience.[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_07_dragon_10": "In recognition of its feats and accomplishments,\nit can be given a Ribbon.[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_07_dragon_11": "To give an example, if you manage to become\nincredibly close to a Pokémon, it may be granted\\r\nthe Best Friends Ribbon.[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_07_dragon_12": "Incidentally, there is a person in Cascarrafa who\ncan give your Pokémon a Best Friends Ribbon.[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_07_dragon_13": "Marks, on the other hand, are mostly found on\nwild Pokémon when you meet them for the\\r\nfirst time.[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_07_dragon_14": "They can symbolize the character of a Pokémon,\nsuch as with the Rowdy Mark or the Vigor Mark.[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_07_dragon_15": "It’s completely up to luck whether you’ll run into\na Pokémon with these marks![npcn:12]",
  "class_f_07_dragon_16": "So if you’re able to catch a Pokémon with a\nmark, rejoice at your outstanding fortune![npcn:12]",
  "class_f_07_dragon_17": "Does anyone know what special thing you can do\nwith Pokémon that have Ribbons or marks?[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_07_select_01": "You can exchange Ribbons!",
  "class_f_07_select_02": "You can show them off!",
  "class_f_07_select_03": "You can change their title!",
  "class_f_07_dragon_answer_01": "Ah, unfortunately, you can’t transfer Ribbons or\nmarks from one Pokémon to another, nor can you\\r\ntrade them with other people’s Pokémon.[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_07_dragon_answer_02": "Well, yes, indeed you can show them off, but\nsurely that’s not the extent of your interest, is it?[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_07_dragon_answer_03": "[BD06:0]Wonderful, [trnm:0]! Your\nknowledge\\r\nis\\r\nimpressive.[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_07_dragon_18": "The correct answer is that Pokémon with Ribbons\nor marks can be given titles.[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_07_dragon_19": "What’s more, they can be sent into battle\ndisplaying a title of your choosing![npcn:12]",
  "class_f_07_dragon_20": "For example, you could send out a Gible with\na Best Friends Ribbon by declaring...\\r\n“Go! Gible the Great Friend!”[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_07_dragon_21": "And while I know I just said that marks are\ngenerally found already on Pokémon when you\\r\nmeet them for the first time...[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_07_dragon_22": "it seems that more recently, Pokémon can be\nawarded certain marks based on their efforts.[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_07_dragon_23": "These are marks such as the Gourmand Mark,\nthe Itemfinder Mark, the Partner Mark, and so on.[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_07_dragon_24": "Perhaps it might be fun to try to work out how to\nget each mark using its name as a clue?[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_07_dragon_25": "Well, that just about wraps up our last class![npcn:12]",
  "class_f_07_dragon_26": "Next is the final exam. Please review our material\nclosely so that you pass on your first try![npcn:12]"
