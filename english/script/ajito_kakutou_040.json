  "ajito_kakutou_040_sitappa_15": "She told me that she understood how hard it is\nto have no one on your side...\\c\nAnd she invited me into Team Star.[npcn:3F]",
  "ajito_kakutou_040_nelke_14": "Even after you bullied her like that... What a\nkind girl.[npcn:1E]",
  "ajito_kakutou_040_sitappa_16": "She really is. And joining the team has worked\nout great for us. It’s been so much fun![npcn:3F]",
  "ajito_kakutou_040_nelke_15": "Fun? There are rumors that Team Star likewise\nengages in bullying...[npcn:1E]",

  "ajito_kakutou_040_nelke_16": "Ah, no... I merely...[npcn:1E]",
  "ajito_kakutou_040_sitappa_18": "Riri and the rest of Team Star made me who I\nam today.[npcn:3F]",
