  "class_g_02_home_03": "You can receive Meal Powers and even restore\nHP for all the Pokémon in your party. It is a truly\\r\nconvenient means of healing your Pokémon.[npcn:29]",
  "class_g_02_home_04": "Unfortunately, as I’m sure you are aware, it is not\nsuited for use in battles—when you cannot make\\r\nfood—or when you wish to restore HP quickly.[npcn:29]",
  "class_g_02_home_05": "In times such as those, you should make use of\nhealing items—such as [clr:6]Potions[clr:0], which you can\\r\npurchase from Poké Marts or the school store.[npcn:29]",
  "class_g_02_home_06": "Healing items are immediately effective and can\nbe used anytime that you can open your Bag.\\r\nThey are, however, consumed after one use.[npcn:29]",
  "class_g_02_home_07": "Potions restore 20 HP, Super Potions restore\n60 HP, and Hyper Potions restore 120 HP.[npcn:29]",
  "class_g_02_home_08": "The pricier the item, the more HP it will restore.\nKeep in mind how much money you have when\\r\nyou are stocking up on these items.[npcn:29]",
  "class_g_02_home_09": "However, unforeseen happenings are an\ninextricable part of traveling from place to place.[npcn:29]",
  "class_g_02_home_10": "Imagine, if you will, the following scenario: you\nfind yourself with injured Pokémon, but you have\\r\nno Potions, you are out of sandwich ingredients,\\r\nand there are no Pokémon Centers nearby.[npcn:29]",
  "class_g_02_home_11": "Tell me, M[aster;iss:g] [trnm:0]...\\c\nWhat should you search for when in a perilous\nsituation with no way to heal your Pokémon?[npcn:29]",

  "class_g_02_home_answer_01": "Would you hope to use the water to prepare a\nbracing meal perhaps?\\c\nAs I mentioned, you have no ingredients, so even\nwith water, you would not be able to make food.[npcn:29]",
  "class_g_02_home_answer_02": "Ah, yes. Of course, if a teacher were nearby, they\ncould likely be of assistance.\\c\nHowever, you must not assume that a grown up\nwill always be nearby to rush to your aid.[npcn:29]",
  "class_g_02_home_answer_03": "[BD06:0]Perfectly correct, M[aster;iss:g]\n[trnm:0]!\\r\nI see\\r\nyou\\r\nare\\r\nwell-learned\\r\nin\\r\nsurvival techniques.[npcn:29]",

  "class_g_02_home_14": "And then there are Berries, of course.\\c\nBerries, by the way, aren’t like items from shops—\nif you let your Pokémon hold one, it will decide\\r\non its own when to eat the Berry during battle.[npcn:29]",
  "class_g_02_home_15": "Letting your Pokémon decide this timing for itself\ncan be quite interesting![npcn:29]",
  "class_g_02_home_16": "At any rate, if you find yourself in need of\nhealing, I suggest that you look around for\\r\nshining items on the ground.[npcn:29]",
  "class_g_02_home_17": "If you can’t find such items, there are other\nmethods you may employ for healing your—\\c\nAh, but I see the bell demands that topic wait.[npcn:29]",
