  "class_g_03_home_03": "However, after class, I was asked by several of\nyou about [clr:6]Power Points[clr:0], commonly known as [clr:6]PP[clr:0].[npcn:29]",

  "class_g_03_home_06": "When a Pokémon runs out of PP, it can no longer\nuse its moves.[npcn:29]",
  "class_g_03_home_07": "However, each move has its own store of PP, so\nyou can mitigate PP loss by using a variety of\\r\nmoves rather than just one move repeatedly.[npcn:29]",
