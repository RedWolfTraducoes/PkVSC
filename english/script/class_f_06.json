  "class_f_06_dragon_01": "Hello, class! It is I, Hassel, yet again.[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_06_dragon_02": "First, allow me to apologize for losing my\ncomposure during our last class...[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_06_dragon_03": "I was so touched by Brassius’s story that I simply\ncouldn’t contain my emotions. I’m sorry for\\r\nmaking such a scene.[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_06_dragon_04": "I certainly got a very stern talking-to from\nMs. Tyme after that class, yes...[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_06_dragon_05": "Anyway, let us shift gears and dive into the\nmaterial for today’s class![npcn:12]",
  "class_f_06_dragon_06": "Now, have any of you heard of the Ten Sights\nof Paldea?[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_06_dragon_07": "As the name would imply, they are ten sights in\nPaldea that are considered particularly beautiful.[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_06_dragon_08": "Among them, I would say that the[clr:6] Grand Olive[clr:0]\n[clr:6]Orchard[clr:0] is likely the most accessible.[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_06_dragon_09": "You can see field after field of olive trees from\nthe hill on the way to Cortondo.[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_06_dragon_10": "Two waterfalls are also counted among these\nten sights—[clr:6]Fury Falls[clr:0] and [clr:6]Casseroya Falls[clr:0].[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_06_dragon_11": "Then there’s the peak of Glaseado Mountain,\nknown as [clr:6]Paldea’s Highest Peak[clr:0].[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_06_dragon_12": "There’s another cliff on Glaseado Mountain that’s\nnamed after its rather unique shape.[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_06_dragon_13": "So, let me ask you, my students![npcn:12]",
  "class_f_06_dragon_14": "What is the name of the three-pronged cliff on\nGlaseado Mountain? No need to grasp at straws![npcn:12]",
  "class_f_06_select_01": "Glaseado’s Grasp",
  "class_f_06_select_02": "Glaseado’s Reach",
  "class_f_06_select_03": "Glaseado’s Run",
  "class_f_06_dragon_answer_01": "[BD06:0]Exactly! It looks like a hand taking hold of\nsomething, doesn’t it, [trnm:0]?[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_06_dragon_answer_02": "A very good guess! I’d think something reaching\nwould stretch out farther, though.[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_06_dragon_answer_03": "A unique take! But that sort of name would\nusually apply to a slope, don’t you think?[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_06_dragon_15": "The three-pronged cliff on Glaseado Mountain\nis in fact known as [clr:6]Glaseado’s Grasp[clr:0].[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_06_dragon_16": "Though its shape is far too stubby to be that\nof a human hand. I imagine someone thought it\\r\nlooked like a Pokémon hand grabbing something.[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_06_dragon_17": "There’s also the mountains in Area Three of the\nEast Province, where you can get a good look at\\r\nLevincia. It’s particularly gorgeous at night![npcn:12]",
  "class_f_06_dragon_18": "In fact, the view is so brilliant, it is known as the\n[clr:6]Million Volt Skyline[clr:0].[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_06_dragon_19": "I hear it’s quite a hotspot for dates—and\ndeservedly so for having such a romantic view![npcn:12]",
  "class_f_06_dragon_20": "I imagine it’s...what do the kids say these days...\na very, ahem, “fleek selfie spot”?[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_06_dragon_21": "Of course, you may feel that not all ten sights live\nup to their grandiose names. How often do we\\r\nvisit some tourist spot only to be disappointed?[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_06_dragon_22": "Not to say that you shouldn’t visit them, only\nthat you should keep your hopes in check.[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_06_dragon_23": "The important thing is to go yourself and see\nthem with your own two eyes.[npcn:12]",
  "class_f_06_dragon_24": "And sometimes, a disappointing experience can\nbe worthwhile in its own way. Take a chance![npcn:12]",
  "class_f_06_dragon_25": "Well, that’s it for today, class. Thank you for\nyour attention![npcn:12]"
