  "legend_0010_select_02": "I don’t think we’ve met...",
  "legend_0010_friend_02a": "Yeah, exactly! That’s my little know-it-all buddy!\nGot a mind like a steel trap, eh?[npcn:6]",
  "legend_0010_friend_02b": "What?! Come on, I gave you [pknm:1]’s\nPoké Ball! Did I forget to introduce myself...?[npcn:6]",
  "legend_0010_friend_03": "Well, the name’s Arven.[npcn:6]",
  "legend_0010_friend_04": "[BD06:0]No need to tell me your name.\n[trnm:0], right?[npcn:6]",
  "legend_0010_friend_05": "Whole school seems to be talking about you.\\c\nThe new kid who showed up with the president\nof the student council.[npcn:6]",
  "legend_0010_friend_06": "I normally wouldn’t even bother showing up for\nclass, but I came all the way to school today\\r\njust to talk with you—our new celebrity.[npcn:6]",

  "legend_0010_friend_09": "Hehehe... Caught your interest, have I? You want\nto hear all about my dream, right?[npcn:6]",
  "legend_0010_friend_10": "Well, this might come as a surprise, but fact is,\nI’m all about that picnic life: the great outdoors,\\r\nthe perfectly prepared sandwiches, all of it.\\c\nNot half bad at cooking either, I can tell you.[npcn:6]",
  "legend_0010_friend_11": "Right now I’m researching new recipes that’ll help\nPokémon feel better. Real health food, see.[npcn:6]",
  "legend_0010_friend_12": "I found this book the other day, and it had a\nsection about these Herba Mystica things...[npcn:6]",
  "legend_0010_friend_13": "Basically, they’re some kind of special herbs that\nheal up any Pokémon as soon as it eats them![npcn:6]",
  "legend_0010_friend_14": "Now, there are a total of five different types of\nHerba Mystica, based on what I read.\\c\nJust taking a little lick of them once they’ve been\npowdered will get your blood flowing, provide\\r\nnutrients, prevent aging—it’ll even boost the\\r\nimmune system![npcn:6]",
  "legend_0010_friend_15": "These herbs seem like they’re the real deal.\nOnly found here in Paldea—and rare to boot![npcn:6]",
  "legend_0010_friend_16": "But this book says they’re all guarded by Titan\nPokémon, meaning that it’s gonna be pretty\\r\ntough to try to grab even a few sprigs.[npcn:6]",
  "legend_0010_friend_24": "’Cause, see, Titans are— Well, I think they’ve\ngotta be...things like this![npcn:6]",
  "legend_0010_friend_17": "I really want to get those herbs for myself, but...\nI’m not very good at Pokémon battles.[npcn:6]",
  "legend_0010_friend_18": "Don’t have any friends with strong Pokémon to\nlend me a hand, either...\\c\nAnd I’d never hear the end of it if I went crawling\nto that student council girl...[npcn:6]",
  "legend_0010_friend_19": "But here you waltz up! You’ve got to help me out\nwith this—you’d be perfect![npcn:6]",
  "legend_0010_friend_20": "Nope! Wait! I don’t need an answer yet![npcn:6]",
  "legend_0010_friend_23": "I’ll just register the places where it seems there\nmight be Titans in your map app for you.[npcn:6]",
  "legend_0010_friend_21": "Let it stew a bit, and we can get more into the\ndetails later. And in the meantime...take this.\\r\nA little gift for listening and all.[npcn:6]",
  "legend_0010_friend_22": "Give the idea some serious thought! Please![npcn:6]"
