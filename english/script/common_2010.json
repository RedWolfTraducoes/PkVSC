  "common_2010_head_teacher_07": "However. Since this was necessary to protect\nPaldea and its precious ecosystems, I am willing\\r\nto overlook that particular point.[npcn:A]",

  "common_2010_top_14": "To find this out, I ask that you bring your full\nmight as Champion to bear against each of the\\r\nGym Leaders and test their prowess in battle.[npcn:11]",
  "common_2010_top_15": "They are all Trainers of exceptional talent,\nhandpicked by me personally.\\c\nI do not expect you’ll find any cracks in their\narmor, but...well. Consider it a formality.[npcn:11]",
  "common_2010_top_16": "This will also provide the perfect stage for your\nfirst appearance as a new Champion.[npcn:11]",
  "common_2010_top_17": "Since all the Gym Leaders will still be expecting\nme to carry out the inspection, I imagine they’ll\\r\nhave mustered their full strength.\\c\nI daresay they might be more of a challenge than\nwhen you faced them before.[npcn:11]",
  "common_2010_rival_06": "You get to have all-out battles with the Gym\nLeaders?! Man, I’m jealous...[npcn:4]",
  "common_2010_top_18": "Now then, on to another crucial matter.\\c\nI’d like to discuss with Penny here how to patch\nthe weaknesses in our League Point system.[npcn:11]",

  "common_2010_top_20": "Excellent. We’ll leave you all to it, then. Come\nnow, Penny.[npcn:11]",
  "common_2010_rival_07": "This is awesome, [trnm:0]!\\c\nShow this inspection thing who’s boss so that\nLa Primera can join our tournament, OK?\\c\nAnd enjoy taking another swing at the Gym\ngauntlet while you’re at it![npcn:4]",
  "common_2010_rival_08": "I’ll take care of filling out the forms and other\nadministrative stuff so the ball gets rolling on the\\r\ntournament in the meantime![npcn:4]",
